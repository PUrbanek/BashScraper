# BashScraper

Libraries used
====================

Scraping library
---------------------
https://github.com/ruippeixotog/scala-scraper

I chose this particular scraping library because:
1) It has a decent amount of contributors (8) and the main contributor responds to issues,
2) It has a very low barrier of entry,
3) Alternatives like Nutch or ScalaTest with Selenium are overkills.

JSON library
---------------------
https://github.com/lift/framework/tree/master/core/json

With JSON library I was mainly looking for an easy setup and possibility to create JSON ASTs easily.
I chose lift because it, despite being relatively old, is actively worked on and contains necessary features.

Typesafe config
---------------------
https://github.com/lightbend/config

For task at hand anything more that barebones typesafe config is unnecessary.
